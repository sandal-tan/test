# Project Planning Test

I like the automatability of GitHub Projects and want to see if I can easily automate the flow I have in mind

# Todo

- [x] Mark tasks without a time and prioritization as invalid
- [ ] Keep invalid tasks in the To Do column of the sprint board
- [ ] Make a branch and draft PR for users when stories get moved to In progress -> https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v17#git-create-ref
- [ ] If a task gets added to a milestone, also add it to the sprint board
- [ ] Terraform for boards and labels
